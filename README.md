# ADAPT-AID-IEEE-Social-Code-Hackathon-
ADAPT AID is a web application which has been developed , to cater to the most essential needs of physically disabled people.
The app provides conveyance and hospital booking facilities to users. The interface is user friendly , thus enhancing its utility.
Vehicles registered under the ADAPT AID web app would have portable ramps and other facilities for people with disabilities.
Additional features which we would like to incorporate in our web app:
a) Voice-to-text conversion to convey the demands of the users
b) Voice instructions to provide instructions to users on how to use each feature
c) Additional features to ensure safety 
To ensure that only deserving people get access to these facilities , we connect our webapp with the database collected from official sites of hospitals , which enhances user authentication as well.
